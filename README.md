#The Why

Competitiveness is at the heart of the human condition. Thousands of years ago survival of the fittest arose as a natural consequence 
of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. To win here was to survive, to live longer than your fellow animals. As time passed we realized that 
society and technology eliminated the need to compete against the world for the right to continue existing. With our main rival out of
the picture, we as a species now looked for a new outlet to fulfil this basic need.

We now turned against our fellow human in the spirit
of competition. At it's base level, this competition proved to be no substitute for what our ancestors were used for. There was no 
drive to win; at best it was trite, dispassionate, and in no way a replacement for the thrills of the past. So we raised the stakes.
By placing bets we once again found competition being directly dovetailed to survival. But it still wasn't enough.

For some the thrill could not be satisfied merely through direct peer-to-peer gambling. Casinos and other institutions arose as a result
of those who pushed for more and more competition in their lives. The results were disastrous. Many have lost their entire life's work to
this addiction. People enter with the intent of winning, and end up losing not only their money, but their dignity as well. 

We thought this was unacceptable. With Pickl we aimed to cut out the middleman in this process. Surely we have evolved enough as a species
and a society to no longer need to rely on financial ruin as a means of embarrassment. Pickl allows users to experience the same thrill of
gambling without any of the monetary risk. 

#The What

It's simple, Pickl works in a three-step process.

1. First, all willing participants upload their wagers: an embarrassing photograph that the loser must be willing to part with
2. Next, the wager is decided amongst participants. Ultimately, the loser is decided externally and reported to Pickl by user vote
3. Finally, only the loser's wager is uploaded to social media sites, revealing their shame, but maintaining their finances.
