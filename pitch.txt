Humans are competitive by nature. Normally, we express this through gambling, which typically involes both a loss of shame, which 
then typically leads to a loss of dignity. With our app, Pickl, we are aiming to cut out this middleman, allowing users to jump
straight to gambling away their dignity. Pickl allows groups of friends to get together, each upload an embarassing photo of themselves,
decide a wager externally, and then vote on a loser. Pickl will then upload this embarassing information to social media sites, shaming the loser,
while leaving their wallets unscathed.
